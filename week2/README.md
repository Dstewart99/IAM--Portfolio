### ✅ Day 2 – Least Privilege & RBAC

- Reviewed the principle of least privilege and role-based access control (RBAC), focusing on giving users only the minimum access needed to perform their job duties.
- Compared how security groups in Active Directory and roles in Microsoft Entra ID can both be used as building blocks for RBAC instead of granting permissions user-by-user.
- Documented 3 real access scenarios from my help desk experience and described how RBAC would handle them:
  - New hire: Assign the user to department and job function groups so they automatically get access to the correct apps and shared resources.
  - Role change (mover): Remove the user from old role/department groups and add them to new ones so their access updates with their job.
  - Offboarding (leaver): Disable the account and remove group memberships to ensure access is revoked across all linked systems.
