## 🎯 Goal

Document my hands-on identity labs and 30-day IAM study plan focused on:

- Joiner–Mover–Leaver (JML) lifecycle
- Least privilege, RBAC, and access reviews
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and Active Directory
- Okta fundamentals (SSO/MFA) through self‑study labs

---

## 🔑 Active Directory & Entra ID Labs

### Lab 0 – Active Directory Foundations
- Managed on-premises AD user accounts and password resets in a help desk role.
- Created and updated security and distribution groups to control access to shared resources.
- Disabled accounts and removed group memberships for leavers as part of JML.

### Lab 1 – Entra Users & Groups
- Created multiple test Entra ID users and security groups.
- Assigned users to groups based on role (Helpdesk, Finance, HR).
- Practiced disabling and re-enabling accounts for movers and leavers.

### Lab 2 – Conditional Access & MFA
- Built a Conditional Access policy to require MFA for sign-ins from non-compliant or risky locations.
- Tested sign-ins with several test accounts to verify prompts and blocks.
- Documented expected vs actual behavior and basic troubleshooting steps.

### Lab 3 – PIM (Privileged Identity Management)
- Reviewed Global Administrator, User Administrator, and Security Administrator roles.
- Practiced just-in-time role activation with PIM (eligible → active).
- Noted how PIM reduces standing admin access and supports least privilege.

## ☁️ Okta Labs (In Progress)

These are labs I am completing as part of my 30-day IAM plan to build Okta experience.

### Planned Lab 1 – Users, Groups, and Assignments
- Create test Okta users and groups (Helpdesk, Contractors, HR).
- Assign applications and policies based on group membership.
- Practice JML operations for new hires, department changes, and terminations.

### Planned Lab 2 – SSO App Integration
- Set up a mock application with Okta using SAML-based SSO.
- Map basic attributes (email, first name, last name) for the sign-in flow.
- Test logins from the Okta dashboard into the application.

### Planned Lab 3 – MFA Policies and Group Rules
- Create an MFA policy requiring stronger factors for admin and high‑risk users.
- Configure group rules to auto-assign users to groups based on department attribute.
- Link MFA and group rules back to least privilege and JML lifecycle.

## 📘 30-Day IAM Study Progress

### Week 1 – IAM Foundations

**Day 1 – IAM Basics**
- Defined Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Governance.
- Learned the Joiner–Mover–Leaver (JML) lifecycle and wrote examples from my help desk work.
- Created and reviewed IAM flashcards for these core terms:

  - Identity: Who the user/account is.
  - Authentication: Proving identity (password, MFA).
  - Authorization: What the user is allowed to access.
  - Governance: Policies, approvals, and reviews that control access.
  - JML: Joiner (new hire), Mover (role change), Leaver (offboarding).

**Day 2 – Access Models**
- Reviewed Least Privilege and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Compared groups vs roles using examples from AD and Entra ID.
- Documented 2–3 real access scenarios and how RBAC would apply.

_(Add more days here as you complete them.)_

## 🧠 Core IAM Skills

- **Identity lifecycle:** Joiner–Mover–Leaver (provisioning, access changes, deprovisioning).
- **Access control:** Least privilege, RBAC, Segregation of Duties (SoD).
- **Microsoft stack:** Active Directory and Entra ID (users, groups, Conditional Access, basic PIM).
- **In progress:** Okta fundamentals (SSO, MFA, group rules) through labs and self‑study.
- **Operations:** 3+ years handling daily access requests and identity tickets in an M365/AD-heavy help desk environment.
