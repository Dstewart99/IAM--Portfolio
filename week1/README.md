### ✅ Day 1 – IAM Basics

- Defined Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Governance.
- Learned the Joiner–Mover–Leaver (JML) lifecycle and wrote examples from my help desk work.
- Created and reviewed IAM flashcards for these core terms:
  - Identity: Who the user/account is.
  - Authentication: Proving identity (password, MFA).
  - Authorization: What the user is allowed to access.
  - Governance: Policies, approvals, and reviews that control access.
  - JML: Joiner (new hire), Mover (role change), Leaver (offboarding).
