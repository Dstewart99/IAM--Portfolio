### ✅ Day 3 – Risk Concepts

- Defined Segregation of Duties (SoD) as splitting high‑risk steps between different roles so one person cannot control an entire process. Example: regular end users can use applications on their laptops, but only IT admins are allowed to install or approve new software. This separates “using” from “controlling” the software.
- Reviewed excessive access and over‑provisioning risk, including how users can slowly collect permissions over time when they change roles but old access is never removed.
- Noted 3 example risky access scenarios:
  - An end user has local admin rights on their workstation and can install any software they want, increasing malware and data exfiltration risk.
  - A former project member still has access to a shared mailbox and SharePoint site with sensitive files months after leaving the team.
  - A contractor account keeps high‑privilege directory or admin permissions after their contract ends instead of being downgraded or disabled.
