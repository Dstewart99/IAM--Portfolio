### ✅ Day 5 – Identity Governance (IGA)

- Compared IAM vs IGA: Identity and Access Management (IAM) focuses on the mechanics of accounts, authentication, and authorization (who can log in and what they can do), while Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) adds the governance layer on top — approvals, policies, access reviews, and reporting to make sure access stays appropriate and compliant over time.
- Noted common IGA activities like scheduling regular access reviews, asking managers or app owners to confirm which permissions their users still need, and running SoD checks to catch unsafe combinations of access.
- Wrote a short summary of Identity Governance:
  - Identity Governance is the set of policies, processes, and tools I use to make sure the right people have the right access, that this access is approved and reviewed regularly, and that the organization can demonstrate this to auditors. It builds on IAM by adding workflows for access requests and approvals, scheduled access reviews, SoD controls, and compliance reporting so that access stays aligned with business roles and regulations over time.
