### ✅ Day 4 – Access Reviews

- Learned that access certifications (user access reviews) are periodic checks where managers or system owners verify that each user still needs their current access and revoke anything that is no longer required.
- Noted that auditors and regulations expect periodic access reviews (often quarterly or annually) to prove that the company is controlling permission creep and removing unnecessary or risky access over time.
- Wrote a simple access review workflow:
  - Who: Application owners and people managers review access for their users (for example, a manager reviews their team’s access to key apps and shared mailboxes).
  - What: They check which users have access, what roles/groups they are in, and whether that access still matches each person’s job.
  - How often: Run reviews on a regular schedule (for example, quarterly for high‑risk systems and at least annually for lower‑risk apps).
